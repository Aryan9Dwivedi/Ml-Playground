# ML Playground

An interactive, browser-based machine learning visualization playground built with **React + Vite + Tailwind CSS**.

This project helps users understand core machine learning algorithms through **interactive visualizations, parameter tuning, and step-by-step intuition**, all running fully in the browser.

The application is deployed as a **static site** and works independently without any backend.
